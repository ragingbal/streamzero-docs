## The {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} Suite
The {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} DX suite is a platform of complementary PaaS and SaaS services. Built on open source technologies, there are four layers of technologies and services, building on top of each other.

## Capabilities

The **{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} Technology Foundation** is built on an overt and flexible Kubernetes cluster, making its implementation fast and easy. For the same reason, {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} easily integrates with practically any other technology or services, regardless of its location, be it on premise or any cloud service provider.

**{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} FX** *(the Executor)* forms the heart for the {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} DX Suite of **Event driven Services and Integrations** solutions. Soon to be completely programming *language agnostic* it is the Engineers tool to develop, orchestrate and run any combination of services with each other.

With **{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} SX** *(Streaming Automation)* we have taken a good thing and made it better. While Kafka is already core to the *{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} DX* suite, {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} SX forms an optional add-on by which adding new data sources and services into the streaming cluster is made faster and a lot more efficient.

**{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} Event driven Kubernetes** *(K8X)* forms a milestone in effective and efficient **Kubenetes Cluster Management** - saving valuable time, resources and money! Never has is been so easy to connect containers from across locations with each other, letting K8X automatically and driven solely by triggering events start and stop them.

## Users

{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} is built for users and teams for an autonomous and effective process and applications development lifecycle.

**Built by Enginers - for Engineers!**

Our goal is to build our solutions to make you lifes easier, and that includes of course writing and bundling product and training documentation with these audiences in mind:

- #### Developers

  With *Developers* we mean everyone who builds and develops services and functions aimed at automating and improving data and service functions. This may be a *Software Developer*, *DevOps*, *Data Engineer* or *Data Scientist*.

  Here's how you get started: [Developer Guide](/docs/overview/{{< param replacables.brand_name_lowercase  >}}_fx/developerguide)

- #### Engineers

  *Platform Engineers* as well as *DevOps* are largely responsible for setting up, maintaining and operating {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}}. This may be as straight forward as on a single cloud instance. But more and more we see {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} being applied across multiple clouds and on-premise infrastructures.

  Here's how you get started: [Integrations Guide](/docs/overview/{{< param replacables.brand_name_lowercase  >}}_fx/integrationsguide)

- #### Non-Tech (users)

  {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} is not only for the techies, but also for non-technically oriented users like *Analysts* and *Security Administrators*. And because of that, there is ample documentation provided to explain how {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} is setup to manage projects and access rights.

  Here's how you get started: [User Guide](/docs/overview/{{< param replacables.brand_name_lowercase  >}}_fx/userguide)
