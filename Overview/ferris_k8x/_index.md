## What is {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} K8X

{{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} K8X is the first *Event driven Kubernetes*, invoking and terminating containers upon demand. Meaning, a containers default state is dormant and only invoked upon a pre-defined event happening.

Event Driven Kubernetes works across any Kubernetes cluster, be it within {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} or across external clusters, such as cloud based services and applications.

The purpose of {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} K8X is to concatenate containers and their associated services with each other, therefore building a chain of event driven services. Since each service or container is invoked upon an event trigger, they (service, container) are dormant and require no compute resources.

This embedded and event driven nature of K8X makes it not only easy to use and fast to deploy, it brings unprecedented levels of resources effiecncy to any Kubernetes Cluster.
